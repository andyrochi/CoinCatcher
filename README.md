## Testing Environment
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition

## How to Run

The dependencies are packed in the `Dependencies/` directory, which we include the following libraries:
* [freeglut 3.0.0](https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/)
* [glew 2.1.0](https://glew.sourceforge.net/index.html)


Simply open the `CoinCatcher.sln` file in Visual Studio to open the project.
As long as OpenGL is configured on your PC (which is usually installed along with Microsoft Visual Studio), it should run without problems.
Press `<Ctrl> + <F5>` to build without debugging.
